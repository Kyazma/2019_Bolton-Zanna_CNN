This repository contains the python code used for the paper titled 

"Applications of Deep Learning to Ocean Data Inference and Sub-Grid 
Parameterisation".

I would have included the data from the quasi-geostrophic (QG) ocean 
model, but the .mat files are too large to included on GitHub. However,
the train neural networks are available in the models/ directory.
